/**
 * Challenge
 * 
 * Task: Using the saved deckId, draw 2 new cards from the deck
 * 
 * Docs for original Deck of Cards API: https://deckofcardsapi.com/#draw-card
 * BaseUrl you'll use: https://apis.scrimba.com/deckofcards/api/deck/
 * (that will replace the base url of https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/)
 * that you'll see in the deck of cards API docs.
 * 
 * 1. Create a new button that, when clicked, draws 2 cards from the deckId
 * you have saved
 *      Note: you'll need to get a new deck every time you refresh the page,
 *      since you're only saving your deckId in a local variable right now
 * 2. Log those 2 cards to the console
